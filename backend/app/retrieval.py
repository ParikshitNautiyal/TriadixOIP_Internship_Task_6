    Given a natural-language question, return the most semantically
    relevant chunks from the vector store.

    Steps:
      1. Embed the question with the same local embedding model used for chunks.
      2. Query ChromaDB for the top_k nearest chunks (cosine distance).
      3. Drop chunks whose distance exceeds `max_distance` -- these are
         probably not actually relevant, and including them tends to
