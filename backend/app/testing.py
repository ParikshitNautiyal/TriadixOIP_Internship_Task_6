----------
Handles the "response testing" hands-on concept.

Provides a small, dependency-free test runner that exercises the full
pipeline (retrieval -> RAG -> citations) against either a predefined set
of sample questions or questions the user types in. This is intentionally
simple (no pytest/CI setup) since the goal is to let the user SEE how
well retrieval, grounding, and citations are working -- not to build a
production test suite.
