rag_pipeline.py
----------------
Handles the "RAG" and "question answering over documents" hands-on
concepts: building a grounded prompt from retrieved chunks and calling
the LLM (Groq) to produce a final, cited answer.

This is the ONLY place in the app that makes a network call to an LLM.
Embeddings and retrieval are fully local; the LLM is invoked once per
user question, exactly when an answer needs to be generated.
